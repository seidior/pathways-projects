# Pathways Module 1: Setting up your Git repository

This project is to create an interactive climate data tool for a given city. The
first step is to create a command-line-based tool to read and parse the climate
data then output summary information, then the following steps will turn that
into a browser-based tool and then a query-able API.

To run the code:

1. Clone this repository to your local.
2. In the top-level directory, run `npm install`. (`yarn` and `pnpm` are also
   supported.)
3. Run `npm run climateTool -w packages/cli` to run the tool.
